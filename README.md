# Student Union App

Can be used as an official University of Salford Student Union app containing
features that host it’s weekly events along with a food/drink menu and information
page. It’s weekly events include a pub quiz (which will be made to be completely online
where users can answer questions from their phone along with team leaderboards), a
karaoke night which will have a built in queueing system rather than writing down
song names on a piece of paper, and a comedy night in which the schedule and links
to each of the comedians’ social media will be included.

The aim of this project is to see how much companion apps such as these can increase
event engagement and attendence and to try and improve student social life on campus
in the post-covid era.
